# Maze of Waze - Graph Algorithms

This project is about building a [directed weighted graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph), operate some Algoithms, and do that on GUI.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk13-downloads-5672538.html)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or some other IDE

### Installing

Clone that project to your workspace directory

```
git clone https://github.com/NetanelAlbert/OopEx2-Maze-of-Waze.git
```

Open your IDE and make sure you see the project "OopEx2 Maze of Waze"


## Running the tests

In the [tests](https://github.com/NetanelAlbert/OopEx2-Maze-of-Waze/tree/master/src/tests) package you can find tested for the main classes.
Run each one of them from you IDE.

### Test the GUI

Open [TestGUI](https://github.com/NetanelAlbert/OopEx2-Maze-of-Waze/blob/master/src/tests/TestGUI.java) and run it.
